## üîí **High-Level Summary: IDOR and Related Access Control Issues**

**IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)** occurs when **_applications use user-supplied input to access objects directly, often without proper authorization checks_**. It is a subset of broader issues like **BOLA (Broken Object-Level Authorization)**, which involves failures to enforce authorization at the object level, and **BFLA (Broken Function-Level Authorization)**, where unauthorized actions or operations are performed.

---

## **Key Takeaways**

- **What is IDOR?**
    
    - Applications use user-supplied input (e.g., object IDs) to access resources directly.
    - Example: Changing a URL parameter like `id=123` to `id=124` to view another user‚Äôs account.
    - Found in web apps, APIs, and other contexts (e.g., files, JSON, XML).
    - Known as **BOLA** in APIs.
- **Related Concepts**:
    
    - **BOLA**: Failure to enforce authorization at the object level (superset of IDOR).
    - **BAC (Broken Access Control)**: General category of access control failures.
    - **BFLA**: Focuses on bypassing function-level restrictions (e.g., unauthorized admin actions).
- **How IDOR Works**:
    
    - Relies on predictable or manipulatable object IDs.
    - Often combined with other weaknesses if IDs are hard to guess or brute force.
    - Can involve leaking information via endpoints or data points.

## üìù **Definition Bank**

|**Term**|**Definition**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)**|Accessing objects (e.g., accounts, files) by manipulating object references.|Changing `id=123` to `id=124` in a URL to access another user‚Äôs account.|
|**BOLA (Broken Object-Level Authorization)**|Broader category covering failures to enforce object-level authorization, including IDOR.|Accessing sensitive API data without proper validation.|
|**BAC (Broken Access Control)**|General failures in restricting resource or action access.|Accessing admin pages without proper permissions.|
|**BFLA (Broken Function-Level Authorization)**|Exploiting function-level access to perform unauthorized actions.|Regular user updating another user‚Äôs account details or performing admin functions.|

## üîí **Advanced Notes on IDOR and Access Control**

### **Overview**

- **IDOR**: Focuses on exploiting predictable or manipulatable object references (e.g., IDs in URLs, JSON, or XML).
- **BOLA**: Includes IDOR but also applies to broader object-level failures.
- **BAC/BFLA**: Related to enforcing restrictions at a higher level, focusing on resource or action permissions.

### **Typical Scenarios and Techniques**

1. **Finding and Exploiting IDOR**:
    
    - Look for **endpoints** or **data points** that use IDs or object references.
    - Tools like **Burp Suite** can help identify and brute force IDs.
    - Example: Capturing multiple IDs from a forum or comment section and testing them.
2. **Endpoints Leaking Information**:
    
    - Endpoints might expose data like usernames or emails, aiding brute force or enumeration attacks.
    - Example: Using leaked emails to test for IDOR vulnerabilities.
3. **Testing for BAC/BFLA**:
    
    - Check if unauthorized users can perform restricted actions (e.g., admin-only tasks).
    - Example: Testing if a regular user can update another user‚Äôs account.

## üí° **Examples of Vulnerabilities**

1. **IDOR/BOLA**:
    
    - Manipulating a URL parameter to access another user‚Äôs data.
    - Example: Changing `<id=123>` to `<id=124>` to view another account‚Äôs details.
2. **BFLA**:
    
    - Performing unauthorized functions like account deletion or privilege escalation.
    - Example: Regular user accessing admin controls.
3. **Leaking Information**:
    
    - Endpoints or API responses expose sensitive details, aiding further exploitation.
    - Example: JSON responses containing emails or object references.

## ‚úÖ **Best Practices for Securing Against IDOR and Related Issues**

1. **Validate All Object References**:
    
    - Ensure proper authorization checks for each object access.
2. **Randomize or Obfuscate Object IDs**:
    
    - Avoid using predictable IDs in URLs or endpoints.
3. **Restrict Sensitive Actions**:
    
    - Enforce role-based access for sensitive operations (e.g., admin actions).
4. **Monitor and Test Endpoints**:
    
    - Regularly scan endpoints for information leakage and test with tools like Burp Suite.

## üí≠ **Thought-Provoking Questions**

1. How would you detect and prevent IDOR in a complex application?
2. What‚Äôs the relationship between IDOR and BOLA?
3. How would you secure function-level access controls in an application?

## üìò **Additional Resources**

1. **XML and JSON Examples**:
    
    ```xml
    <user>
        <id>123-124-125-126</id>
        <username>alex</username>
        <email>alex@alex.com</email>
    </user>
    ```
    
    - This can represent object references susceptible to IDOR attacks.

### üß† **Checklist for Testing IDOR and Related Issues**

- **Identify Vulnerable Endpoints**:
    
    - Look for URLs, JSON, or XML containing object IDs.
- **Test for Predictable/Manipulatable IDs**:
    
    - Use tools like Burp Suite to brute force or capture IDs.
- **Validate Access at Function and Object Levels**:
    
    - Check for improper access to resources or actions.
