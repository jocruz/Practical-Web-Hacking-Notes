## **High-Level Summary of the Lab**

1. **Objective**: Exploit an **_Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)_** vulnerability by accessing an unprotected admin functionality endpoint disclosed in the `robots.txt` file to delete the victim user, Carlos.
    
2. **What Makes This an IDOR?**:
    
    - **IDOR** occurs when access control is insufficient, allowing users to directly interact with objects they should not have access to by manipulating parameters or URLs.
    - In this lab, the admin panel is **unprotected**, meaning it relies on obscurity (hiding the endpoint in `robots.txt`) rather than implementing proper authentication or authorization checks. This allows unauthorized users to access admin functionality and perform privileged actions.
3. **Steps**:
    
    - Locate the admin panel endpoint by reviewing the `robots.txt` file.
    - Access the admin panel directly without any authentication.
    - Perform unauthorized actions, such as deleting a user (Carlos).
4. **Techniques Used**:
    
    - Enumeration of hidden endpoints via `robots.txt`.
    - Direct URL manipulation to access restricted functionality.
    - Testing for unprotected administrative actions.
5. **Key Learning**:
    
    - Sensitive endpoints should not rely on obscurity for protection (e.g., hiding in `robots.txt`).
    - Proper access control mechanisms (e.g., authentication, role-based authorization) must be enforced to prevent unauthorized access.

## **What to Do Next (Exam Simulation)**

- When exploring a web application, always:
    - Check for `robots.txt` or use tools like **ffuf** to enumerate hidden endpoints.
    - Attempt direct access to admin or privileged functionality to test for **IDOR** vulnerabilities.
- Log the roles and actions of users you test to build a comprehensive access control matrix.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

- **If the admin panel doesn’t load**:
    - Double-check the path disclosed in `robots.txt` (e.g., `/administrator-panel`).
    - Ensure the full URL is correctly entered in the browser.
- **If unable to perform actions**:
    - Verify that you have accessed the admin panel endpoint.
    - Confirm that the action (e.g., deleting Carlos) triggers a response indicating success.

## **Key Takeaways**

- Relying on obscurity (like hiding admin endpoints in `robots.txt`) is **not secure**.
- Administrative actions should always be protected with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Enumeration of endpoints (via `robots.txt` or tools like **ffuf**) is a common first step in testing for access control vulnerabilities.

## **Step 1: Access `robots.txt`**

1. Append `/robots.txt` to the lab URL in the browser.
    - **Example**: `https://<lab-url>/robots.txt`.
2. Review the contents of the `robots.txt` file:
    - **Disallow: /administrator-panel**.

---

## **Step 2: Access the Admin Panel**

1. Copy the hidden path (`/administrator-panel`) from `robots.txt`.
2. Replace `/robots.txt` in the URL with `/administrator-panel` and navigate to it.
    - **Example**: `https://<lab-url>/administrator-panel`.
3. Confirm that the admin panel loads, despite being **unprotected**.

---

## **Step 3: Delete Carlos**

1. In the admin panel, locate the option to delete users.
2. Select Carlos from the user list and perform the delete action.
3. The lab is complete when Carlos is deleted.

---

## **Step 4: Understand Why This is an IDOR**

1. The admin panel is accessible without any **_authentication** or **authorization_**, violating proper access control principles.
2. The endpoint relies on obscurity (`robots.txt`) rather than security, which attackers can easily bypass.
3. Actions in the admin panel (e.g., deleting users) are **direct object references** that are improperly protected, allowing anyone to perform administrative actions.

## **Core Concept: Why `robots.txt` is Not Secure**

- **What is `robots.txt`?**
    - It’s a file used by websites to tell search engine crawlers which areas to avoid indexing.
- **Why is it insecure?**
    - It’s publicly accessible, so attackers can easily view it to discover sensitive endpoints.
- **How does this relate to IDOR?**
    - Revealing sensitive paths (like `/administrator-panel`) without proper protection creates opportunities for attackers to exploit endpoints and perform unauthorized actions.
