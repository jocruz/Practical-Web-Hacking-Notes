## üîí **High-Level Summary: Weak Access Controls**

_Weak Access Controls_ occur when applications fail to enforce proper restrictions consistently, often due to relying on user-controllable inputs like HTTP methods or headers. These vulnerabilities can lead to unintended behaviors, such as unauthorized access or actions.

---

## **Key Takeaways**

- **Weak Access Controls**:
    
    - Applications may rely on user-supplied inputs for enforcing access controls.
    - Examples of user-controllable inputs include:
        - **_HTTP Methods_** (e.g., GET, POST).
        - **_Headers_** (e.g., `Referer`, `X-Origin-URL`).
- **Missing Access Controls**:
    
    - Access controls might be applied inconsistently across application workflows.
    - Example: Enforced at login but missing for sensitive actions like deleting users.
- **Testing for Weak Access Controls**:
    
    1. Log in as an **admin account** and step through the application's functionality.
    2. Replay the same actions using the cookie/session of a low-privileged user.
    3. Compare HTTP requests (headers, methods) between admin and standard users to identify lapses.

### **Flowchart Overview**

![[Pasted image 20241211093915.png]]

1. **_Login as Admin_** (Green Node):
    
    - **Access Controls:** Enforced.
    - **Headers:** Proper headers are set.
      
2. **_Access Admin Panel_** (Green Node):
    
    - **Access Controls:** Enforced.
    - **Headers:** Proper headers are set.
      
3. **_Delete User_** (Red Node):
    
    - **Access Controls:** **_Not Enforced_**.

---

## üìù **Key Observations**

1. Access controls are enforced during:
    
    - **Login as Admin**.
    - **Accessing Admin Panel**.
2. Access controls are **missing** during:
    
    - The **Delete User** action.
3. Proper headers are set for initial steps but not explicitly mentioned for the **Delete User** action, contributing to the vulnerability.

## ‚úÖ **Actionable Insights**

1. **_Ensure Consistent Access Control Enforcement_**:
    
    - Access controls must be applied uniformly across all application actions, particularly sensitive operations like "Delete User."
      
2. **_Test for Header Manipulations_**:
    
    - Analyze headers like `Referer` and `X-Origin-URL` for bypass vulnerabilities.
      
3. **_Use Security Tools_**:
    
    - Employ tools like **Burp Suite** to compare HTTP requests between different user roles (e.g., admin and standard user).
      
4. **_Simulate Low-Privilege Account Actions_**:
    
    - Replay admin actions using a low-privileged account session to identify potential bypasses.

## üí≠ **Thought-Provoking Questions**

1. What mechanisms can ensure headers are consistently validated across all application actions?
2. How can you effectively test for missing access controls without admin access?
3. What role do HTTP methods play in access control bypass vulnerabilities?

### üß† **Checklist for Testing Weak Access Controls**

- **Analyze HTTP Requests**:
    
    - Compare requests (headers, methods) between admin and standard users.
- **Replay Admin Actions**:
    
    - Use a low-privileged account‚Äôs session to test sensitive functionalities.
- **Verify Consistency**:
    
    - Check if access controls are applied uniformly across all workflows.
- **Examine Header Validations**:
    
    - Test if headers like `Referer` or `X-Origin-URL` can be manipulated to bypass controls.
