    - Locate the `GET /my-account` request in Burp Suite and send it to Repeater.
3. **Modify the `id` Parameter**:
    
    - Change the `id` parameter from `wiener` to `carlos` in Repeater.
    - Send the modified request and review the response.
4. **Retrieve the Victim‚Äôs API Key**:

5. **Complete the Lab**:
    
    - Submit the API key to complete the lab.

## **‚ùì Why This Is an Access Control Issue**

This is an **access control vulnerability** because:

1. The server improperly authorizes users based solely on the `id` parameter in the URL, rather than validating the session cookie or user permissions.
2. There is no check to ensure that the requesting user is authorized to view the data associated with the `id` parameter.
3. Proper access control requires that sensitive operations be tied to authenticated sessions and enforce strict permissions on user actions.
