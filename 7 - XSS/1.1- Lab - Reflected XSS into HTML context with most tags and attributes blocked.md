# üß™ Lab: Reflected XSS into HTML context with most tags and attributes blocked

**Lab URL:** [https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-html-context-with-most-tags-and-attributes-blocked](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/contexts/lab-html-context-with-most-tags-and-attributes-blocked)

## üéØ High-Level Summary

**Objective:** Perform a reflected XSS attack that bypasses a web application firewall (WAF) and calls the `print()` function.

**Key Techniques & Concepts:**

- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
    
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** bypass
    
- **Burp Suite Intruder** for tag/attribute discovery
    

**What Makes This Vulnerable?**

- The web application reflects user input directly into the HTML response.
    
- A WAF attempts to block common XSS payloads but fails to filter specific tags and event handlers.

## üßë‚Äçüíª PortSwigger Solution

1. **Initial Test:** Inject the basic payload:
    
    ```
    <img src=1 onerror=print()>
    ```
    
    - This payload is blocked by the WAF.

2. **Identify Allowed Tags:**
    
    - Open **Burp Suite's browser** and search for `qwerty`.
        
    - Send the resulting request to **Intruder**.
        
    - Replace the search term with `<¬ß¬ß>` and add a positional marker between the brackets.
        
    - Use the [XSS cheat sheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet) and import **all tags** into Burp's payload list.
        
    - Run the attack and **sort results by status code**.
        
    - **Discovery:** The `<body>` tag returned a **200 status code**, indicating it is allowed.

3. **Identify Allowed Event Handlers:**
    
    - Modify the payload to `<body%20¬ß¬ß=1>`.
        
    - Use **Burp Suite's Intruder** with the **event handler list** from the XSS cheat sheet.
        
    - **Discovery:** The event handler `onresize` returned a **200 status code**.

4. **Final Payload Construction:**
    
    - Construct a payload that forces the victim to trigger the event:
        
    
    ```
    <iframe src="https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/?search=%22%3E%3Cbody%20onresize=print()%3E" onload=this.style.width='100px'>
    ```
    
    - Deliver this payload via the **exploit server** to the victim.

## üìö Instructor Solution

1. **Identify Reflection Point:**
    
    - Enter `qwerty` into the search box and confirm reflection in the **source code** between `<h1>` tags.

2. **Test Common Payloads:**
    
    - Inject `<script>prompt()</script>` and observe blocking.
        
    - Test `<img src=x onerror=prompt()>` with similar results.

3. **Filter Enumeration:**
    
    - Send the search request to **Burp Repeater**.
        
    - Use **Burp Suite's Intruder** with the **PortSwigger XSS cheat sheet tags**.
        
    - Confirm allowed tags by observing **200 status codes**.
        
    - Identify `<body>` as an allowed tag after running tests.

4. **Event Handler Testing:**
    
    - Repeat the process with event handlers from the **XSS cheat sheet**.
        
    - Identify `onresize` as an allowed event handler with a **200 status code**.

5. **Encoding Note:**
    
    - The instructor highlights that **URL encoding** is automatically applied, encoding special characters during the payload test.

6. **Exploit Construction:**
    
    - The final payload using `onresize` for the victim to trigger execution:
    
    
    ```
    <iframe src="https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/?search=%22%3E%3Cbody%20onresize=print()%3E" onload=this.style.width='1em'>
    ```
    
    - Deliver the exploit using Burp Suite's **exploit server**.

## üí° Explanation of Payloads and Techniques

**Why the Payload Works:**

- The WAF filters common tags (`<script>`, `<img>`).
    
- The `<body>` tag is allowed and can trigger the `onresize` event handler.
    

**Key Payload Components:**

- `**<iframe>**`**:** Embeds another web page.
    
- `**onresize**`**:** Executes code when the window resizes.
    
- `**print()**`**:** Triggers the browser's print dialog, proving code execution.

## ‚úÖ Decision Tree for XSS Attack Workflow

1. **Identify Reflection Point:** Verify if user input is reflected on the page.

2. **Test Simple Payloads:** Use `<script>alert(1)</script>` and `<img onerror=alert(1)>`.

3. **Tag Testing:** Use Burp Intruder with tags from the XSS cheat sheet.

4. **Event Handler Testing:** Repeat the process with event handlers.

5. **Encoding Check:** Verify if the application applies URL encoding.

6. **Final Payload Construction:** Craft minimal payloads for the allowed tag/attribute combination.

7. **Exploit Delivery:** Send the payload using an **exploit server**.
