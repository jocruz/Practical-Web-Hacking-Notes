# üß™ Lab: Reflected XSS in JavaScript string with angle brackets encoded

## üéØ High-Level Summary

**Objective:** Perform a reflected XSS attack that breaks out of a JavaScript string and calls the `alert` function.

**Key Techniques & Concepts:**

- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
    
- **JavaScript String Injection**
    
- **Breaking Out of JavaScript Context**
    

**What Makes This Vulnerable?**

- The web application reflects user input directly into a JavaScript string without proper encoding.
    
- Angle brackets are encoded, but it fails to properly escape single quotes or string-breaking payloads.

## üßë‚Äçüíª PortSwigger Solution

1. **Initial Test:**
    
    - Submit a random alphanumeric string in the search box.
        
    - Use **Burp Suite** to intercept the request and send it to **Burp Repeater**.
        
2. **Reflection Check:**
    
    - Observe the random string reflected inside a JavaScript string.
        
3. **Exploit Attempt:**
    
    - Replace the random string with:
        
        ```
        '-alert(1)-'
        ```
        
    - Send the modified request and verify the payload is stored.
        
4. **Execution Verification:**
    
    - Right-click the comment link, select **Copy URL**, and paste it into the browser.
        
    - Reload the page to trigger the `alert()` function.

## üìö Instructor Solution

1. **Identify Reflection Point:**
    
    - Submit `qwerty` in the search box and intercept the request using **Burp Suite**.
        
    - Locate the POST request containing the search term.
        
    - Inspect the response and identify the reflection point inside a JavaScript variable:
        
        ```
        var searchTerms = 'qwerty';
        ```
        
2. **Payload Construction:**
    
    - Use the following payload to break out of the JavaScript string:
        
        ```
        qwerty';prompt()//';
        ```
        
    - The payload breaks the string, triggers `prompt()`, and comments out the rest of the line to avoid syntax errors.
        
3. **Exploit Submission:**
    
    - Submit the modified search term and verify the alert box appears.

## üí° Explanation of Payloads and Techniques

**Why** `**'-alert(1)-'**` **Works (Deeper Explanation):**

- The payload includes a single quote (`'`) to break out of the JavaScript string.
    
- `-alert(1)-` is inserted into the JavaScript context as executable code.
    
- The hyphens are ignored as comments since they do not affect the JavaScript execution in this context.
    

**Why** `**qwerty';prompt()//';**` **Works:**

- The single quote (`'`) breaks out of the string.
    
- `prompt()` executes a JavaScript dialog box.
    
- The double forward slashes (`//`) comment out the remaining code to avoid syntax errors.
    

**Why** `**"><script>alert(1)</script>**` **Fails:**

- Since angle brackets are encoded, the `<script>` tag is rendered ineffective.
    
- Breaking out of a JavaScript string requires bypassing the quote escape mechanism.
    

**Key Payload Components:**

- `**'-alert(1)-'**`**:** Breaks out of the string and executes code.
    
- `**qwerty';prompt()//';**`**:** Achieves the same by commenting out the remaining code.
    
- **Commenting the Line:** `//` prevents the remaining code from breaking.
