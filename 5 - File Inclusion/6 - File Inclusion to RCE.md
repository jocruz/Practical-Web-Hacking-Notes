## üîí **High-Level Summary: Achieving Remote Code Execution (RCE) with File Inclusion Vulnerabilities**

**File Inclusion Vulnerabilities** can sometimes be leveraged to achieve **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**. However, successful exploitation depends on several factors, including the server's configuration and available attack surfaces. Key techniques include:

- **Log File Poisoning:** Injecting payloads into server logs and executing them via file inclusion.
    
- **Uploading a Web Shell:** Uploading a malicious script and executing it through file inclusion.
    
- **Proc Self Environment Technique:** Injecting code into `/proc/self/environ` and executing it.
    
- **SSH Key Theft:** Stealing an SSH key and using it for unauthorized access.

|**Term**|**Definition**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**Log File Poisoning**|Injecting a payload into server logs and executing it via file inclusion.|Placing a PHP payload in the User-Agent header for execution.|

## üìñ **Key Techniques for RCE via File Inclusion**

### **Log File Poisoning**

- **Method:**
    
    - Inject payload into HTTP headers (e.g., User-Agent).
        
    - Payload is written to server logs.
        
    - Use the file inclusion vulnerability to reference the log file and execute the payload.
        

**Example:**

```
GET /index.php?file=/var/log/apache/access.log
User-Agent: <?... system($_GET['cmd']); ...?>
```

- **Note:** This technique is often seen in Capture the Flag (CTF) scenarios but rarely in production environments.
    

### **Web Shell Upload**

- **Method:**
    
    - Upload a PHP web shell via an upload functionality.
        
    - Use the file inclusion vulnerability to execute the uploaded shell.
        

**Example:**

```
http://localhost/index.php?file=uploads/shell.php
```

### **Proc Self Environment Technique**

- **Method:**
    
    - Inject a payload into the `/proc/self/environ` file using HTTP headers.
        
    - Use the file inclusion vulnerability to access and execute it.
        

**Example:**

```
GET /index.php?file=/proc/self/environ
User-Agent: <?... system($_GET['cmd']); ...?>
```

## üß™ **Recommended Exercise:**

- Review the **LFI to RCE** section on **Hactrix**.
    
- Create a **checklist** of techniques.
    
- Apply these techniques in lab environments and penetration tests.

## üß™ **Testing and Mitigation Strategies**

### **Testing Checklist:**

- Check if the application reflects user-controlled input in file paths.
    
- Try including known files like `/etc/passwd`.
    
- Test encoding techniques like Base64 and URL encoding.
    
- Test log poisoning by injecting payloads into headers.
    

### **Mitigation Techniques:**

- Validate and sanitize user inputs.
    
- Use an allowlist for permitted files.
    
- Restrict directory traversal sequences.
    
- Implement proper server permissions.

## ‚úÖ **Key Takeaways:**

- **RCE through file inclusion** often relies on **secondary misconfigurations**.
    
- **File inclusion vulnerabilities** can be dangerous even without RCE.
    
- **Systematic testing** and **input validation** are critical to mitigating risks.
