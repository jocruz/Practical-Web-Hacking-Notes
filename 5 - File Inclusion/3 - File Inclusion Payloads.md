## üîí **Advanced File Inclusion Vulnerabilities**

**File Inclusion Vulnerabilities** occur when applications improperly handle user input to include files dynamically. This can lead to **information disclosure**, **remote code execution (RCE)**, or **privilege escalation**. Advanced file inclusion attacks often involve bypassing filters and exploiting poor security controls.

## üìñ **High-Level Summary**

File Inclusion Vulnerabilities occur when applications use user-controlled input to include files dynamically. They can lead to severe consequences like:

- **Information Disclosure**: Accessing sensitive files.
    
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: Executing external scripts.
    
- **Privilege Escalation**: Gaining higher system privileges.
    

Causes of these vulnerabilities include poor input validation, insecure coding practices, and insufficient path handling.

|**Term**|**Definition**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**Encoding Payloads**|Using techniques like URL encoding or double encoding to bypass filters.|`%252e%252e%252f` instead of `../`.|
|**Pattern Filtering**|Blocking specific patterns in input like `../` or `.php`.|Preventing traversal with hardcoded rules.|
|**Recursive Filtering**|Filters that block patterns only once but not if repeated.|`. ./../` bypassing a single layer filter.|
|**Automatic Extensions**|When the application appends a file extension automatically.|Adding `.jpg` to every input automatically.|

## üìù **Understanding Advanced Concepts**

### **File Inclusion Filtering Bypasses**

Modern web applications often implement filters to block file inclusion attacks. Examples include:

- **Blocking patterns like** `**../**`: Applications may prevent basic directory traversal but can be bypassed with:
    
    ....//
    
    ./.\../
    
- **Preventing access outside specific directories**: E.g., only `/images/` can be accessed. Try:
    
    ../../../../images/../../etc/passwd
    
- **Recursive filters**: If the filter only checks once:
    
    ..\..\..\..\
    
- **Case Manipulation**: Some filters fail to normalize input:
    
    ..//EtC/PassWd

### **Common Filter Bypasses**

**1. URL Encoding**

- Encode special characters to bypass filters.
    

%2e%2e%2fetc%2fpasswd

**2. Double Encoding**

- Apply multiple layers of encoding to obscure payloads.
    

%252e%252e%252fetc%252fpasswd

**3. Null Byte Injection**

- Terminate strings early to bypass extension filters.
    

../../etc/passwd%00.jpg

**4. Parameter Manipulation**

- Modify file parameters that seem suspicious.
    

?file=../../etc/passwd

?lang=../../config.php

## üìù **Methodology: Testing Advanced File Inclusion Vulnerabilities**

1. **Identify Potential Parameters:**
    
    - Look for user-controlled inputs related to file access (`?file=`, `?lang=`).
        
2. **Test Basic Payloads:**
    
    - Use common payloads like:
        
        ../../etc/passwd
        
        ../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts
        
3. **Test Encoded Variations:**
    
    - Try variations like:
        
        %2e%2e%2fetc%2fpasswd
        
4. **Observe Responses:**
    
    - Check for:
        
        - Partial file disclosure.
            
        - Errors indicating blocked payloads.
            
5. **Test Complex Filters:**
    
    - Use case manipulation, double encoding, and recursive patterns.
        
6. **Fuzz with Tools:**
    
    - Use tools like `Burp Suite Intruder` or `ffuf` for payload testing.

## ‚úÖ **Actionable Insights for Prevention**

1. **Sanitize User Input:**
    
    - Reject sequences like `../` and `%2e%2e%2f`.
        
2. **Implement Whitelisting:**
    
    - Only allow specific, pre-approved file paths.
        
3. **Use Secure Inclusion Functions:**
    
    - Avoid dynamic inclusion whenever possible.
        
4. **Monitor and Log Suspicious Activity:**
    
    - Analyze logs for repeated access attempts to sensitive files.
