## üîí **High-Level Summary: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**

**_SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)_** occurs when a server-side application makes requests on behalf of a user, often allowing attackers to access internal resources that are not directly accessible. This vulnerability has become increasingly common and can have significant impacts if exploited effectively.

---

## **Key Takeaways**

- **_What is SSRF?_**
    
    - **_SSRF_** happens when a server-side application:
        - Accepts user input (e.g., URLs) and makes a request to that endpoint.
        - Processes the results and often returns data back to the user.
    - **_Impact_**:
        - Attackers can potentially make the server access **_internal endpoints_** (e.g., admin panels, sensitive APIs) or external malicious resources.
- **_How Does SSRF Work?_**
    
    - **_Original Flow_**:
        - A legitimate request includes user-provided input (e.g., a URL) in a JSON payload.
        - The application uses this input to access a resource (e.g., checking item stock).
    - **_Malicious Flow_**:
        - Attackers provide manipulated input (e.g., internal URLs).
        - The application accesses **_internal endpoints_** like `http://internal.local/admin`.

### **Flowchart Overview**

![[Pasted image 20241213232541.png]]

1. **_User Sends a Request_**:
    
    - JSON payload includes a URL for the server to process (e.g., stock check).
2. **_Server-Side Processes the Request_**:
    
    - Takes the URL input and makes a request to the specified endpoint.
3. **_Vulnerability Exploited_**:
    
    - Malicious input causes the server to access unauthorized internal resources.

## üìù **Key Observations**

1. **_SSRF is Highly Impactful_**:
    
    - Can grant attackers access to internal, sensitive resources.
    - Often leads to further exploitation if the internal endpoints are unprotected.
2. **_Validation Failures_**:
    
    - SSRF relies on the application **_trusting user input_** without proper validation.
    - Inadequate input validation can allow attackers to manipulate requests.
3. **_Common Attack Patterns_**:
    
    - Accessing internal services: e.g., `http://internal.local/admin`.
    - Interacting with specific ports: e.g., `http://internal.local:8000`.

## ‚úÖ **Actionable Insights**

1. **_Validate User Input Strictly_**:
    
    - Implement strong input validation for all user-supplied data, especially URLs.
2. **_Restrict Internal Resource Access_**:
    
    - Block requests to internal IP ranges or sensitive endpoints.
3. **_Use Allowlists_**:
    
    - Only permit requests to trusted external domains or IPs.
4. **_Monitor and Detect Suspicious Behavior_**:
    
    - Use logging to identify and block repeated or unusual requests.

1. How can SSRF vulnerabilities escalate to critical impacts like RCE (Remote Code Execution)?
2. What additional layers of security can prevent SSRF in modern web applications?
3. How would you test for SSRF vulnerabilities in an application?

### üß† **Checklist for Testing SSRF**

- **_Analyze JSON or URL Inputs_**:
    
    - Identify parameters that accept URLs or interact with endpoints.
- **_Test for Input Validation_**:
    
    - Manipulate the URL to point to internal or unauthorized endpoints.
- **_Monitor Server Behavior_**:
    
    - Check if the server makes the unauthorized request and returns a response.
- **_Probe Specific Ports or Endpoints_**:
    
    - Look for interactions with sensitive resources (e.g., admin panels, APIs).
