As with all blind attacks the server is carrying out some action, but the result or data is not included in the HTTP response.

Similar to Blind SQL, we won't be able to view the results of our payload in the HTTP response.
We can still use the same techniques as regular SSRF.

Blind SSRF is notoriously difficult to get information out of.
