# ðŸ§ª Lab: JWT Authentication Bypass via Flawed Signature Verification

Lab URL: [https://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt/lab-jwt-authentication-bypass-via-flawed-signature-verification](https://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt/lab-jwt-authentication-bypass-via-flawed-signature-verification)

## High-Level Summary

**Objective:** Modify a JWT token to gain unauthorized access to the admin panel and delete the user `carlos`.

**Key Techniques & Concepts:**

- **JWT Structure:** Header, Payload, Signature
    
- **Flawed Signature Verification:** The server is misconfigured to accept unsigned JWT tokens.
    
- **Token Manipulation:** Modify the `sub` claim and remove the signature for privilege escalation.
    

**What Makes This Vulnerable?**

- The server fails to verify the signature of the JWT token, making it possible to remove the signature and modify claims.

## PortSwigger Solution

1. **Log into the Lab:**
    
    - Use the provided credentials: `wiener:peter`.
        
2. **Capture the JWT:**
    
    - In **Burp Suite**, go to **Proxy > HTTP history**.
        
    - Locate the `GET /my-account` request after login.
        
    - Observe the `session` cookie containing a JWT.
        
3. **Decode the JWT:**
    
    - Double-click the JWT payload in **Burp Inspector**.
        
    - Review the tokenâ€™s structure and claims (`sub` containing `wiener`).
        
4. **Modify the Token:**
    
    - Send the request to **Repeater (Ctrl+R)**.
        
    - Change the request path from `/my-account` to `/admin`.
        
    - Modify the `sub` claim from `wiener` to `administrator` using the **JWT** tab.
        
5. **Change the Signing Algorithm:**
    
    - Select the **JWT Header** in **Burp Inspector**.
        
    - Change the `alg` value from `RS256` to `none`.
        
    - Remove the signature but keep the trailing dot `.`.
        
6. **Access the Admin Panel:**
    
    - Send the modified request and confirm access to the admin panel.
        
7. **Delete the User** `**carlos**`**:**
    
    - Locate the `/admin/delete?username=carlos` endpoint.
        
    - Send the request with the modified JWT to delete `carlos` and complete the lab.

## Instructor Solution

### Step 1: Log into the Web Application

- Visit the `/login` page and log in with the credentials `wiener:peter`.
    
- Navigate to **Burp Suite > Proxy > HTTP History**.
    

### Step 2: Inspect the JWT Token

- Locate the POST `/login` request where a JWT token is issued.
    
- Identify the JWT components in the **JSON Web Token** tab:
    
    - **Header:** Algorithm (`alg`: RS256)
        
    - **Payload:** Subject (`sub`: wiener)
        
    - **Signature:** Base64-encoded signature
        

### Step 3: Modify the JWT Claim

- Send the `/my-account` request to **Repeater**.
	- Remove the `?id=wiener` parameter from the URL, leaving just `/my-account`.
    
- Change the `sub` claim from:
    
    ```
    "sub": "wiener"
    ```
    
    to:
    
    ```
    "sub": "administrator"
    ```
    
- Click **Apply changes** in Burp.
    

### Step 4: Change the Signing Algorithm

- Select the JWT header in **Burp Suite Inspector**.
    
- Change the `alg` value from `RS256` to `none`.
    
- Remove the signature manually from the token while retaining the trailing dot.
    

### Step 5: Using the Modified Token in the Browser

- Copy the modified JWT token from **Repeater**.
    
- Open **Developer Tools > Application > Cookies** in the browser.
    
- Replace the existing `session` cookie with the modified JWT.
    
- Remove the `?id=wiener` parameter from the URL, leaving just `/my-account`.
    

### Step 6: Access Admin Panel and Delete Carlos

- Confirm access to the **Admin Panel** using the modified token.
    
- Navigate to `/admin/delete?username=carlos` and send the request.
    

### Step 7: Using the **Attack Button** in Burp Suite

- The **Attack Button** in the **JWT Tab** automates:
    
    - Changing the `alg` claim to `none`.
        
    - Removing the signature portion of the token.
        
- This simplifies the attack process while testing.

## Explanation of Payloads and Techniques

### **JWT Structure:**

A JSON Web Token (JWT) consists of three parts separated by periods (`.`):

1. **Header:** Specifies the signing algorithm (`RS256` by default).
    
2. **Payload:** Contains claims, such as `sub` and `exp`.
    
3. **Signature:** Ensures token integrity and authenticity.
    

### **Why the Attack Works:**

- The server is configured to accept tokens where the `alg` is set to `none`.
    
- By modifying the **JWT Header** and setting `alg: none`:
    
    - No signing key is required.
        
    - The token's integrity is no longer validated.
        
- Removing the signature and modifying the `sub` claim allows privilege escalation.
    

### **Key Attack Variations:**

- **Removing the Signature Manually:** Deleting the signature after the payload.
    
- **Changing the Algorithm to** `**none**`**:** Using the **Attack Button** in **Burp** for automation.
