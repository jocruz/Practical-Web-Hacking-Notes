# ðŸ§ª Lab: JWT Authentication Bypass via JWK Header Injection

Lab URL: [https://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt/lab-jwt-authentication-bypass-via-jwk-header-injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt/lab-jwt-authentication-bypass-via-jwk-header-injection)

## High-Level Summary

**Objective:** Modify and sign a JWT token using the `jwk` header to gain unauthorized access to the admin panel and delete the user `carlos`.

**Key Techniques & Concepts:**

- **JWT Structure:** Header, Payload, Signature
    
- **JWK Header Injection:** The server allows attackers to embed an untrusted key directly in the JWT token for signature verification.
    
- **Token Manipulation:** Modify the `sub` claim and embed an attacker-controlled public key for privilege escalation.
    

**What Makes This Vulnerable?**

- The server fails to verify whether the provided public key (`jwk`) originated from a trusted source.

## PortSwigger Solution

1. **Set Up Burp Suite:**
    
    - Load the **JWT Editor** extension from the **BApp Store**.
        
2. **Log into the Lab:**
    
    - Use the credentials `wiener:peter`.
        
    - Send the `GET /my-account` request to **Burp Repeater**.
        
3. **Modify the JWT Token:**
    
    - Change the request path from `/my-account` to `/admin`.
        
    - Send the request and observe that access is denied.
        
4. **Generate an RSA Key:**
    
    - Go to the **JWT Editor Keys** tab.
        
    - Click **New RSA Key** > **Generate** > **OK**.
        
5. **Modify the JWT Claims:**
    
    - In the **JWT Tab** of Repeater, change the `sub` claim to `administrator`.
        
6. **Inject the JWK Key:**
    
    - Click the **Attack** button and choose **Embedded JWK**.
        
    - Select the previously generated RSA key and click **OK**.
        
7. **Review the JWT Header:**
    
    - Confirm the `jwk` parameter containing the attacker-controlled public key has been added.
        
8. **Send the Modified Request:**
    
    - Send the request and verify successful access to the admin panel.
        
9. **Delete the User** `**carlos**`**:**
    
    - Locate the `/admin/delete?username=carlos` endpoint.
        
    - Send the request and complete the lab.

## Instructor Solution

### Step 1: Log into the Web Application

- Use the credentials `wiener:peter` and capture traffic using **Burp Suite**.


### Step 2: Identify the JWT Token

- Locate the `GET /my-account` request containing a JWT token.
    
- Send the request to **Repeater**.
	- *Make sure to delete the ?id=weiner in the Request Header*


### Step 3: Generate an RSA Key

- Go to the **JWT Editor Keys** tab.
    
- Click **New RSA Key** and generate a key pair.


### Step 4: Modify the Token

- In the **JWT Tab**:
    
    - Change the `sub` claim from `wiener` to `administrator`.
        
    - Click **Attack** > **Embedded JWK**.
        
    - Select the generated RSA key and confirm.

### Step 5: Send the Request

- Send the modified request to `/admin` and verify successful access.


### Step 6: Apply the Token in the Browser

- Copy the modified JWT from Burp Repeater.
    
- Go to the browser's **Developer Tools > Application > Cookies**.
    
- Replace the session cookie with the modified JWT.
    
- Change the URL to `/my-account` and press **Enter**.


### Step 7: Delete the User `carlos`

- Go to `/admin/delete?username=carlos` to delete the user and complete the lab.

## Explanation of Payloads and Techniques

### **JWT Structure:**

A JWT consists of three parts separated by periods (`.`):

1. **Header:** Specifies the algorithm and key type.
    
2. **Payload:** Contains claims such as `sub` and `exp`.
    
3. **Signature:** Ensures token integrity and authenticity.
    

### âœ… **Why It Works? (Key Concept)**

- The server **trusts** the attackerâ€™s key from the token instead of its own.
- Since the attacker **controls both the signature and the key**, they can generate a valid token pretending to be any user (like `administrator`).

---

**Think of it like this:**  
You hand a bouncer your own "ID" (JWK in the token) and **they don't check it against their official records**â€”they just trust whatever you gave them. ðŸš¨

### **Key Attack Variations:**

- **Embedded JWK Injection:** Using an attacker-controlled key to sign tokens.
    
- **None Algorithm Attack:** Removing the signature entirely (from previous labs).
