## ✅ **What is a JWT (JSON Web Token)?**

A **JWT** is a token used to prove a user's identity. It contains **three parts**:

```plaintext
Header.Payload.Signature
```

### **1. Header:**

- Specifies the **algorithm** used for signing (`RS256`)
- Example:
    
    ```json
    {
      "alg": "RS256"
    }
    ```
    

### **2. Payload:**

- Contains **claims** (data) about the user, like:
    
    ```json
    {
      "sub": "wiener",
      "role": "user"
    }
    ```
    

### **3. Signature:**

- A **cryptographic signature** generated using:
    - The **server's private key**
    - **Header + Payload** combined
    - Example:
        
        ```plaintext
        Signature = sign(Header + Payload, privateKey)
        ```
        
- Ensures the token **wasn't tampered with**.

## ✅ **How JWT Verification Works (Secure Process)**

When a server **receives a JWT** (like in a cookie):

1. **Splits the Token:**
    - Breaks it into `Header.Payload.Signature`.
2. **Ignores Any Key Inside the Token:**
    - The server **ignores** any keys sent inside the JWT.
3. **Recalculates the Signature:**
    - Using its **trusted public key** stored on the server.
4. **Compares Signatures:**
    - If the **computed signature** matches the **one in the token** → Token is **valid** ✅
    - If they **don't match** → Token is **rejected** ❌

---

### **Example Code (Secure Verification):**

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const fs = require('fs');

const publicKey = fs.readFileSync('./public.pem');

const token = "eyHeader.eyPayload.Signature";

// Verify the token using the **trusted** public key
jwt.verify(token, publicKey, { algorithms: ['RS256'] });
```

---

## 🚩 **What is a JWK (JSON Web Key)?**

A **JWK** is just a public key formatted in **JSON**.

### **Example JWK:**

```json
{
  "kty": "RSA",
  "n": "attacker-controlled-public-key",
  "e": "AQAB"
}
```

---

### **Legitimate Use of JWKs:**

✅ Sometimes, services like Google and Microsoft **rotate keys** frequently and need a way to:

- Share public keys with third parties securely.
- The server might reference a **trusted key URL**, but **not** trust keys embedded in the token directly.

---

---

## 🚩 **How Does the JWK Vulnerability Work?**

The vulnerability occurs when **a developer allows the attacker to provide their own public key inside the token**.

---

### **1. Attacker Creates a JWT with a Fake Key:**

```json
{
  "alg": "RS256",
  "jwk": {
     "kty": "RSA",
     "n": "attacker-public-key",
     "e": "AQAB"
  }
}
```

---

### **2. Attacker Signs the Token with Their Private Key:**

- Attacker generates **their own key pair**.
- They sign the token with their **private key**.

---

### **3. Vulnerable Server Code:**

```javascript
const decoded = jwt.decode(token, { complete: true });
const jwk = decoded.header.jwk;  // 🚩 Attacker injects a fake key here

// 🚩 Server trusts the attacker's key instead of its own stored key
jwt.verify(token, jwk.n, { algorithms: ['RS256'] });
```

---

### **4. Why This Works:**

- The attacker **controls the entire key pair**.
- They sign the token with their **private key**.
- The server **trusts the key provided inside the token** instead of using its own stored public key.
- Since the attacker controls both the **public key (jwk)** and **signature**, the token appears valid.

---

---

## ✅ **How It Should Work (Proper Code Fix)**:

```javascript
const publicKey = fs.readFileSync('./public.pem');
jwt.verify(token, publicKey, { algorithms: ['RS256'] });
```

---

### **Key Difference:**

- ✅ **Proper:** Server **ignores** the JWK and uses its **own stored public key**.
- ❌ **Vulnerable:** Server **trusts the JWK** in the token instead of its own key.

---

## 🎯 **Why Would Developers Code This Way? (Mistake Explained)**

1. **Key Rotation Misunderstanding:**
    
    - Developers might think JWKs help with **key rotation** and assume it's safe to let tokens be "self-validating."
2. **Misunderstanding JWT's Purpose:**
    
    - JWTs are meant to be **immutable** and verified by the server's **own key**.
    - Some developers think a token should "self-validate" by providing its own key.
3. **Convenience Over Security:**
    
    - Letting tokens bring their own keys seems easier for distributed systems — but it breaks the whole **integrity** model of JWTs.

---

---

## ✅ **Final Recap (Simplified Again):**

- **JWTs** prove identity using a **server-signed** token.
- The **server** should only verify the token using its **own trusted public key**.
- **JWK Injection** occurs when the server **trusts a public key inside the token itself.**
- The attacker can **create their own key pair**, sign the token, and make it appear valid.

---

### 🎯 **TL;DR:**

- **JWT:** Signed by the server → Only the server's public key should verify it. ✅
- **JWK Attack:** Attacker injects a fake key → Server **trusts** it and the attacker bypasses security. ❌

Does that make sense now? Would you like me to show a live example or a test case? 😊
