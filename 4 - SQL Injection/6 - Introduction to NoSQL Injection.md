## üîí **High-Level Summary: NoSQL Injection**

**_NoSQL Injection_** occurs when an application fails to properly validate user input, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries. Unlike SQL injection, NoSQL injection exploits the query logic of databases like MongoDB, leveraging flexible schemas and operators such as `"$ne"`, `"$gt"`, or `"$regex"`. This can lead to:

- Unauthorized access (e.g., bypassing authentication).
- Data manipulation (e.g., modifying or deleting records).
- Information disclosure (e.g., exposing sensitive data).

## üìù **Definition Bank**

|**Term**|**Definition**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**NoSQL Databases**|Databases designed for unstructured or semi-structured data, offering flexibility, scalability, and high performance.|MongoDB (Document Store), Redis (Key-Value Store), Cassandra (Wide-Column Store), Neo4j (Graph Database).|
|**NoSQL Injection**|A vulnerability where user input manipulates NoSQL database queries, leading to unintended behavior.|Sending `{ "$ne": "" }` in a login payload to bypass authentication.|
|**MongoDB Operators**|Special symbols used to query or manipulate data in MongoDB.|`$ne` (not equal), `$gt` (greater than), `$regex` (pattern matching).|
|**Input Validation**|A security practice to ensure user input is sanitized and safe for processing.|Rejecting payloads with operators like `$ne` or special characters.|
|**$ne Operator**|A MongoDB operator meaning "not equal to."|`{ "password": { "$ne": "" } }`: Matches any record where `password` is not an empty string.|

## üìù **Understanding Key Concepts**

### **NoSQL Injection in MongoDB**

1. **Vulnerable Code Example**:
    
    ```javascript
    db.users.find({username: req.body.username, password: req.body.password});
    ```
    
    - **Problem**: User input is directly passed to the database query without validation.
    - **Impact**: Attackers can inject MongoDB operators to manipulate the query logic.
2. **Injection Payload**:
    
    ```json
    {
      "username": "admin",
      "password": { "$ne": "" }
    }
    ```
    
    - **Explanation**:
        - `username: "admin"`: Targets the `admin` account.
        - `password: { "$ne": "" }`: Matches any record where the password is **not empty**.
3. **How the Query Changes**:
    
    ```javascript
    db.users.find({username: "admin", password: { "$ne": "" }});
    ```
    
    - This query returns the `admin` user as long as their password is not empty.

### **Why NoSQL Injection Works**

- **Flexible Query Syntax**: NoSQL databases like MongoDB support operators (e.g., `$ne`, `$regex`) in queries.
- **No Schema Validation**: Unlike relational databases, NoSQL databases do not enforce strict schemas, making it easier to inject malicious payloads.
- **Trust in Input**: Applications that do not sanitize input are vulnerable to injection.

## üîí **Step-by-Step Example: Bypassing Authentication**

1. **Normal Login Attempt**:
    
    ```json
    {
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "wrongpassword"
    }
    ```
    
    - **What happens**: If the password is incorrect, the query fails, and the user is not logged in.
2. **Injection Payload**:
    
    ```json
    {
      "username": "admin",
      "password": { "$ne": "" }
    }
    ```
    
    - **What happens**: The query matches any record where:
        - `username` is `"admin"`.
        - `password` is **not empty**.
    - **Outcome**: The query returns the `admin` user, and the attacker gains access.

## üìù **Methodology: Testing and Exploiting NoSQL Injection**

1. **Identify Input Fields**:
    
    - Look for user input fields that interact with the database (e.g., login forms, search bars).
2. **Inject Test Payloads**:
    
    - Use payloads like `{ "$ne": "" }`, `{ "$gt": "" }`, or `{ "$regex": ".*" }` to test for injection.
3. **Observe Responses**:
    
    - Check if the application behaves differently (e.g., successful login or unexpected data exposure).
4. **Bypass Authentication**:
    
    - Inject payloads targeting sensitive accounts (e.g., `username: "admin"` and `password: { "$ne": "" }`).
5. **Extract Data**:
    
    - Use operators like `$regex` for pattern matching or `$gt` for conditional queries.

### **Real-World Use Case**

An IoT application using MongoDB fails to validate user input. Attackers bypass login authentication by injecting the following payload:

```json
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": { "$ne": "" }
}
```

Result: The attacker gains administrative access to control IoT devices.

## ‚úÖ **Actionable Insights**

1. **_Always Validate Input:_**
    
    - Sanitize user input to reject MongoDB operators (`$ne`, `$gt`, `$regex`).
    - Use libraries like [MongoDB Sanitize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongo-sanitize).
2. **_Use Authentication Best Practices:_**
    
    - Encrypt passwords using algorithms like **bcrypt**.
    - Avoid exposing database query logic directly to users.
3. **_Implement Parameterized Queries:_**
    
    - Ensure user input is treated strictly as data, not query logic.
    - Use tools like [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) to abstract query logic securely.
4. **_Monitor Query Behavior:_**
    
    - Log and analyze query patterns to detect unusual injection attempts.

## üíº **Possible Interview Questions**

1. **What is NoSQL injection, and how does it differ from SQL injection?**
    
    - **Answer:** _NoSQL injection exploits the flexible query logic of NoSQL databases like MongoDB, using operators like `$ne` or `$regex`. Unlike SQL injection, NoSQL injection often relies on manipulating JSON payloads._
2. **How does the payload `{ "password": { "$ne": "" } }` bypass authentication?**
    
    - **Answer:** _The `$ne` operator matches any password that is **not empty**, allowing attackers to bypass authentication._
3. **What steps would you take to prevent NoSQL injection?**
    
    - **Answer:** _Sanitize input to block special operators, use parameterized queries, and validate user input._
4. **What makes NoSQL databases particularly vulnerable to injection attacks?**
    
    - **Answer:** _The lack of strict schemas and reliance on flexible query operators increase the attack surface._
5. **How would you test for NoSQL injection vulnerabilities in a login form?**
    
    - **Answer:** _Inject payloads like `{ "password": { "$ne": "" } }` or `{ "$regex": ".*" }` and observe if the response changes._
