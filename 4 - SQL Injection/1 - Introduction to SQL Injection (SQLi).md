## üîí **High-Level Summary: SQL Injection (SQLi)**

**_SQL Injection (SQLi)_** is a critical vulnerability that allows attackers to manipulate database queries, breaking the **_secure design principle of separating data and code_**. This typically results in:

- **_Exposure of sensitive data_**.
- **_Data manipulation_**.
- **_Denial of Service (DoS)_**.

---

## üìù **Definition Bank**

|**Term**|**Definition**|
|---|---|
|**SQL Injection (SQLi)**|A vulnerability where user input is used in database queries without proper validation, allowing manipulation of queries.|
|**Dynamic Query**|A query that combines user input with SQL code, making it vulnerable to SQL injection if not handled properly.|
|**Parameterized Query**|A query that uses placeholders for input values, ensuring input is treated strictly as data, preventing SQL injection.|
|**Prepared Statement**|A compiled SQL statement stored by the database and executed with different parameters, separating SQL logic from input.|
|**Injection Flaws**|Vulnerabilities caused by applications treating user input as code instead of data, leading to unintended behaviors like SQL injection.|
|**ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**|A tool that bridges programming languages and databases by allowing developers to interact with databases using objects instead of SQL.|
|**Fuzzing**|A technique that sends a wide range of payloads to identify vulnerabilities by observing unexpected behavior.|
|**' OR 1=1-- -**|A payload that exploits SQL injection by creating a true condition (`1=1`) and commenting out the rest of the query (`-- -`).|

---

## üìù **Why Key Concepts Work**

1. **Why does `' OR 1=1-- -` work?**
    
    - This payload creates a logical condition in the query:
        
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1-- -;
        ```
        
    - The `1=1` always evaluates to **true**, so the query returns all rows.
    - The `--` starts a SQL comment, ignoring the rest of the query (e.g., `password = 'pass'`).
2. **Why use `-- -` with three dashes?**
    
    - The `--` is the SQL syntax for starting a comment.
    - The space (`-`) is used because some databases require a space after `--` for the comment to be recognized.

---

## üîí **Dynamic Queries vs. Parameterized Queries**

### **Dynamic Query: Vulnerable**

```sql
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$user_input'";
```

- **_Explanation:_** User input is concatenated directly into the SQL query, making it vulnerable to injection.
- **_Example:_** Inputting `' OR 1=1-- -` changes the query to:
    
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1-- -;
    ```
    
    This bypasses authentication.

---

### **Parameterized Query: Secure**

```sql
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?";
$stmt = $connection->prepare($query);
$stmt->bind_param("s", $user_input);
$stmt->execute();
```

- **_Explanation:_** The query uses a placeholder (`?`) for input, ensuring the input is treated as data.
- **_Why Secure:_** It prevents input like `' OR 1=1-- -` from being executed as SQL logic.

---

## üîí **What is a Prepared Statement?**

- A **prepared statement** is a pre-compiled SQL query stored by the database.
- **_How it works:_**
    1. The query is compiled once and stored (e.g., `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?`).
    2. Input values are provided later, ensuring separation of data and SQL logic.
- **_Why it‚Äôs effective:_** Prevents SQL injection by ensuring user input is always treated as data.

---
### **Prepared Statements vs Parameterized Queries**

---

#### **Prepared Statement: Overview**

- A **prepared statement** is a SQL query that is precompiled and stored by the database **before runtime**.
- **_How it works:_**
    1. The query is defined with placeholders (e.g., `?`) and sent to the database.
    2. The database compiles the query structure and ensures it is **fixed**.
    3. User input is added later as data, keeping the query logic intact.
- **_Why it‚Äôs effective:_**
    - Separates SQL code from user input, neutralizing malicious payloads.
    - Allows the database to optimize query execution for repeated use.

---

#### **Parameterized Query: Overview**

- A **parameterized query** is the process of securely passing user input into a query using **placeholders**.
- **_How it works:_**
    1. Placeholders (`?`) in the query indicate where user input will go.
    2. Input values are bound to these placeholders at runtime, ensuring the data is escaped.
    3. The database treats input as **literal data**, not executable SQL code.
- **_Why it‚Äôs effective:_**
    - Prevents input like `' OR 1=1-- -` from being executed as SQL logic.
    - Eliminates the risk of SQL injection by escaping special characters.

---

#### **Key Difference**

|**Prepared Statement**|**Parameterized Query**|
|---|---|
|Precompiles the query **once**.|Binds input **safely at runtime**.|
|Optimized for reuse by the database.|Focused on secure input handling.|
|Larger process that uses parameters.|A specific feature within prepared statements.|

### **TL;DR**

- **Prepared Statement**: Ensures query structure is fixed before adding input.
- **Parameterized Query**: Makes sure input is securely passed into the query. Both work together to prevent SQL injection. üöÄ

## üîí **Injection Flaws**

- **Definition:** Vulnerabilities where applications treat user input as code, leading to unintended behavior.
- **Examples of Injection Flaws:**
    - **SQL Injection**: Manipulating database queries.
    - **Command Injection**: Executing OS commands via input.
    - **LDAP Injection**: Manipulating directory service queries.

## üîí **ORM: Strengths and Limitations**

### **What is ORM?**

- **_Definition:_** Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools allow developers to interact with a database using objects instead of SQL queries.
    - Example: Instead of writing `SELECT * FROM users`, you might use `session.query(User)` in an ORM.

---

### **How ORM Protects Against SQL Injection**

- **_Uses Parameterized Queries:_** ORMs automatically separate data and SQL logic.
    - Example:
        
        ```python
        user = session.query(User).filter_by(name="Alice").first()
        ```
        
        This query treats `name="Alice"` as data, not code.

---

### **Why ORM is Not Foolproof**

1. **Misconfiguration Risks:**
    - Developers might bypass ORM safeguards, like manually concatenating input:
        
        ```python
        session.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_input}")
        ```
        
2. **Logic Flaws:**
    - ORMs abstract database logic, making it harder to identify hidden vulnerabilities.
3. **Performance Issues:**
    - Inefficient queries generated by ORMs can lead to denial of service (DoS).

---

## üîí **Examples of SQL Injection**

1. **Authentication Bypass**
    
    - **Query:**
        
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password';
        ```
        
    - **Payload:**  
        `username=' OR 1=1-- -`
    - **Result:** Bypasses login since `1=1` is true.
2. **Data Extraction**
    
    - **Query:**
        
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '$category';
        ```
        
    - **Payload:**  
        `category=' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users-- -`
    - **Result:** Returns user credentials.

## ‚úÖ **Actionable Insights**

1. **_Use Parameterized Queries and Prepared Statements:_**
    
    - These should always be the first defense against SQL injection.
2. **_Combine with Input Validation:_**
    
    - While not a primary defense, input validation adds an additional layer of security.
3. **_Secure ORM Configurations:_**
    
    - Avoid raw SQL execution or manually concatenating input in ORM methods.
4. **_Test All Input Points:_**
    
    - Focus on form fields, URL parameters, and headers.

## üìù **Possible Interview Questions with Answers**
---

1. **How would you test for SQL injection in APIs using JSON payloads?**
    - **Answer:**  
        _"To test for SQL injection in APIs, I would first identify fields in the JSON payload that accept user input, such as `id`, `username`, or `query`. I would craft payloads like `"' OR 1=1-- -"` or `"' UNION SELECT NULL-- -"` and observe the server's response for anomalies like database errors or unauthorized access to data. Additionally, I would use tools like Burp Suite to send automated payloads and analyze API responses for signs of SQLi vulnerabilities."_  
        _"If anomalies are detected, I would validate the findings using manual techniques or tools like SQLmap."_

---

2. **What are common mistakes developers make when using ORMs that could lead to SQL injection?**
    - **Answer:**  
        _"One common mistake is improperly concatenating user input into ORM query methods instead of using built-in parameterized methods. For example, using `session.execute(f'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_input}')` instead of `session.query(User).filter_by(id=user_input).first()`. Another mistake is misconfiguring the ORM, which might inadvertently expose sensitive data."_  
        _"Additionally, relying solely on ORMs for security can be risky if developers aren't aware of how the ORM handles queries behind the scenes, potentially leading to injection vulnerabilities."_

---

3. **Why is input validation not sufficient as the sole defense against SQL injection?**
    - **Answer:**  
        _"Input validation helps filter potentially malicious input but does not address the root cause of SQL injection, which is the mixing of data and code. A determined attacker could bypass validation using encoded payloads or unforeseen input types. To fully prevent SQL injection, we need to use parameterized queries or prepared statements that ensure user input is treated strictly as data and never executed as SQL logic."_

---

4. **Can you explain the difference between prepared statements and parameterized queries?**
    - **Answer:**  
        _"Prepared statements involve compiling an SQL statement once and executing it multiple times with different parameters. This separation of statement preparation and execution ensures SQL code and input data remain distinct. Parameterized queries, on the other hand, are a broader concept where placeholders are used in the SQL query, and user input replaces those placeholders at runtime. Both approaches aim to prevent SQL injection by treating inputs as data."_

---

5. **How would you identify a vulnerable SQL query during a code review?**
    - **Answer:**  
        _"I would look for dynamic SQL queries where user input is concatenated directly into the query string, such as:_
        
        ```sql
        $query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + user_input;
        ```
        
        _Instead of using this approach, I would recommend parameterized queries like:_
        
        ```sql
        $query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?";
        $stmt = $connection->prepare($query);
        $stmt->bind_param("s", user_input);
        $stmt->execute();
        ```
        
        _I would also check for improper use of ORMs, such as directly embedding variables into query strings, which can similarly lead to vulnerabilities."_
